The GIT repository has 2 main directories:
- 1. NumericSequenceCalculator which contains the *Numeric Sequence Calculator* project and *Unit Test* projects
- 2. NumericSequenceCalculatorUITest which contains the *UI Test* project

All projects must be opened in Visual Studio 2013 or later.

### Numeric Sequence Calculator project
To start, open the solution file NumericSequenceCalculator.sln located in the NumericSequenceCalculator directory.
Then run the *Numeric Sequence Calculator* project to display the web page where numbers can be entered, and the 6 numeric sequence lists can be displayed, as required by the test.

### Unit Test project
The *Unit Test* project contains all 6 case scenarios in order to verify if a number belongs to a specific list.

### UI Test project
To test the *UI Test* project, first make sure the *Numeric Sequence Calculator* project is running within Internet Explorer 11 (*the URL must be http://localhost:22657*).
Then open the *UI Test* project and run the only test within it.
The test will demonstrate how a sequence of four different numbers (5, -9, 20 and 15) is handled by the *Numeric Sequence Calculator* application. At the end of the test, all lists are resetted.
